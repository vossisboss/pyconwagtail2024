# How To Build More Accessible Websites with Wagtail

Welcome to the repository for our PyCon US 2024 workshop! Here you'll find all the code for our workshop and other resources to help you build more accessible websites.

Why teach this workshop? Well, because the state of accessibility on the Internet is pretty dismal and the more folks who learn how to build websites with accessibility practices built in from day one, the better.

We'll be using [Wagtail CMS](https://wagtail.org) for this workshop. If you enjoy coding with Wagtail, then please consider signing up for [our newsletter](https://wagtail.org/newsletter) or join us at one of our two live Wagtail Space events coming up in June 2024. See which Wagtail Space event is [closer to you](https://www.wagtail.space/).

## Tutorial Steps

Including all the tutorial steps in this README would make for one VERY long document. So rather than making you scroll until the end of time, you can jump to Step 1 and all the other steps in this repository from this list of links. Each branch also contains the final code solution for each step so that you can doublecheck your work as you go.
